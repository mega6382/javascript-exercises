// Lesson 04 exercise: Operators and conditionals
// In your exercise repository, create a branch named `lesson-04-exercise` and switch to it,
// then open `lesson-04.js`, where the questions wait as comments. The file begins with the
// strict mode line. Work beneath each question in order.

// TODO: Part one.
// The file lists ten expressions that mix coercion, strict comparison, and logical
// combination, among them `3 === "3"`, `1 + true`, and `!(5 > 2)`. Write your predicted result
// as a comment beside each expression before running the file, then run it and correct any
// misses, leaving both the prediction and the actual result visible.

// * The provided expressions, write your prediction beside each before running:
console.log(3 === "3"); // prediction: false
console.log(3 == "3"); // prediction:  true
console.log("5" - 1); // prediction:   4
console.log("5" + 1); // prediction:   6     -    51 (forgot about concatenation)
console.log(1 + true); // prediction:  2
console.log(10 >= 10); // prediction:  true
console.log(!(5 > 2)); // prediction:  false
console.log(4 !== "4"); // prediction: true
console.log("b" > "a"); // prediction: true
console.log(0 === -0); // prediction:  true


// TODO: Part two.
// Write one `if` statement with an `else` branch on a variable of your choosing. Run the file
// twice with different values so that each branch has printed at least once, and record each
// run's output in a comment.

let foo = 11;
if (foo > 10) {
  console.log(`${foo} is greater than 10`);
} else {
  console.log(`${foo} is smaller than or equal to 10`);
}

/**
 * First run foo = 10
 * output: 10 is smaller than or equal to 10
 * 
 * Second run foo = 11
 * output: 11 is greater than 10
 */

// TODO: Part three.
// Build an `else if` chain for order pricing: more than 12 items produces one message, more
// than 6 another, and everything else a third. Run it with values that reach every branch, and
// add a comment explaining why the most specific question must be asked first.

let orders = 3;

if(orders > 12) {
  console.log("Free shipping added for 12+ items");
} else if (orders > 6) {
  console.log("Shipping half off for 6+ items");
} else {
  console.log("Full shipping cost");
}

// it is essential to use the most specific conditions first to ensure that the vague branches do not take over and thus the specific one will not be triggered


// TODO: Part four.
// For each of the eight provided values, which include `0`, `"0"`, an empty string, and a
// single space, predict in a comment whether it is truthy or falsy. Verify each prediction
// with `Boolean()` and correct your misses.

// * The eight provided values:
const courtValues = [false, 0, "0", "", " ", "bread", null, undefined];
/**
 * false     = false
 * 0         = false 
 * "0"       = true 
 * ""        = false
 * " "       = true
 * "bread"   = true 
 * null      = false 
 * undefined = false
 */

for(const val of courtValues) {
  console.log(Boolean(val)); // all assumptions correct
}

// TODO: Part five.
// Rewrite the provided day-based `if` chain as a `switch` statement with a `default` case and
// a `break` in every case, and confirm that it prints the same answers for three test days.

// * The provided day-based if chain, rewrite it as a switch beneath it:
const day = "Sunday";
switch (day) {
case "Saturday":
  console.log("Open 7:00 to 14:00");
  break;
case "Sunday":
  console.log("Open 8:00 to 12:00");
  break;
case "Monday":
  console.log("Closed today");
  break;
default:
  console.log("Open 7:00 to 18:00");
  break;
}


// TODO: Part six.
// The file ends with a short broken program that contains an assignment where a comparison was
// intended, and a `switch` with a missing `break`. Run it, observe both incorrect behaviors,
// repair both, and describe each repair in one comment line.

// * The provided broken program, run it, observe both incorrect behaviors, then repair both:
let shopStatus = "closed";
if (shopStatus == "open") {
  console.log("Welcome in");
}
const size = "M";
switch (size) {
  case "S":
    console.log("Small");
    break;
  case "M":
    console.log("Medium");
    break;
  case "L":
    console.log("Large");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown size");
}

// Fixed the assignment to comparison for shopStatus
// Added the break for S and M cases.

// TODO: Part seven.
// Two classic exercises close the lesson. First, the leap year checker: a year is a leap year
// when it is divisible by 4 and not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. Implement the
// rule with the remainder operator and logical operators, and test it against 2024, 1900, and
// 2000. Second, FizzBuzz for a single number: for one number variable, print Fizz when it is
// divisible by 3, Buzz when it is divisible by 5, FizzBuzz when it is divisible by both, and
// the number itself otherwise. The loops lesson scales this to one hundred.


function isLeapYear(year) {
  return (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || (year % 400 === 0);
}

console.log(`2024: ${isLeapYear(2024)}`); // true
console.log(`1900: ${isLeapYear(1900)}`); // false
console.log(`2000: ${isLeapYear(2000)}`); // true

const num = 15;

if (num % 3 === 0 && num % 5 === 0) {
  console.log("FizzBuzz");
} else if (num % 3 === 0) {
  console.log("Fizz");
} else if (num % 5 === 0) {
  console.log("Buzz");
} else {
  console.log(num);
}
// Output for 15: "FizzBuzz"

// TODO: Save deliberately, commit with a clear message, push the branch, and open a pull request
// into main.
// TODO: Submit the link to the pull request for review.
